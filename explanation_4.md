For this problem recursion was a good approach to solving this problem. The
base case is when the user is found the algoiritm will return true. 
Thinking about this problem I considered what would happen if a subgroup added
some other group higher up in the directory as a member. I would end up in 
and infinite recursive call. So I added a set data structure to check if 
we already explored a group, if so I don't recurse over it again.

Overall the worst case running time for this problem is also exponential. 
Looking with our input being a single user and a single group the problem grows 
based on the number of sub groups in each group, and each of those sub groups
can have many subgroups. In the worse case if we do not find the user we will 
iterate over all users in the tree under the initial group, and all of the 
subgroups in the subtree.
