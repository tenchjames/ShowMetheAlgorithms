for both operations i utilized the set data structure to determine if
a value belongs. I made this decision to keep the running time at 
O(n + m) where n = len(list1) and m = len(list2). without the sets 
the brute force approach would have had a loop within a loop 
checking if the item was already found. so the sets improve the time 
complexity.
